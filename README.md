## ðŸ“Š Statistical Modelling and Forecasting Project (Summary)

This project explores statistical modelling and forecasting using three real-world datasets, with a focus on distribution fitting, centile estimation, and predictive modelling using the GAMLSS framework in R. The first dataset (`dbbmi`) contains BMI data of Dutch boys aged 10â€“22, from which BMI values for 20-year-olds were extracted and analyzed using Normal, Gamma, Lognormal, and Inverse Gaussian distributions. The Lognormal distribution provided the best fit based on the lowest AIC. The second dataset (`grip`) consists of handgrip strength measurements of English schoolchildren. Centile curves were modelled using BCCG, BCT, and BCPE distributions, and based on GAIC and residual diagnostics, the BCPE model offered the most accurate representation. The third dataset, sourced from UK government property transaction data (via Kaggle), was used to model and predict house prices across England and Wales. Models such as Normal, Gamma, Lognormal, Generalized Gamma, and Box-Cox t (BCT) were tested, with the BCT distribution emerging as the most effective based on AIC. Across all datasets, model selection was driven by criteria such as AIC, GAIC, and diagnostic checks. R packages like `gamlss`, `gamlss.data`, `gamlss.dist`, `ggplot2`, and `MASS` were central to the analysis. This project demonstrates the versatility and power of GAMLSS models in capturing complex real-world data distributions and producing reliable forecasts. Whether applied to health or economics, such statistical tools reveal patterns that can guide better decision-making.
